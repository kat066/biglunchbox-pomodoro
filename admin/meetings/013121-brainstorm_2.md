## Review issues from last meeting
* No issues from last meeting were discussed

## Content
* Build on brainstorming session from last meeting
    * Added user stories/personas to help bring direction and clarity for our app
    * Identified three main user profiles:
        * Larry Joe, undergraduate Biochem major at UCSD
            *  Scenario: Faced with daunting homework assignments and Larry is prone to burning himeself out due to bad time management and procrastination.
            *  Reasons to Use: Enjoys simplistic design as it is non-distracting; Increases his productivity whenever he uses it, and thus work-life balance is restored.
        * Mo Li, 58 year old professional software developer
            *  Scenario: Mo is very detail-oriented and constantly engrossed in her work, sometimes working at most 10 hours at a time.
            *  Reasons to Use: She would like to use the timer to effectively manage her work schedule as stress-free as possible, enjoying the number of breaks the timer has to offer.
        * Tiffany, Creative Writing graduate student
            * Scenario: Faced with a frustrating writer's block for most of her creative-writing projects, Tiffany wants a way to overcome this for her next project.
            * Reasons to Use: The Pomodor timer is perfect for jotting down quick ideas and thoughts to escape writer's block; Breaks also give her the opportunity to clear her mind and come back with fresh ideas.
* Had preliminary discussions on project implementation 
    * Group had learned that we were *not* supposed to make use of external frameworks; Source code should consist of HTML, CSS, and vanilla/plain JS
   
## Plan
* Research and prepare a couple of ideas on how we can implement our desired features and how our app can be decomposed given our tool/language constraints
* Have an idea on what features we truly want implemented considering our given time frame

## Decisions
* No decisions were made
