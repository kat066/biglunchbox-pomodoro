## Review issues from last meeting
* No issues from last meeting were discussed

## Content
* Backend:
	* Finished Focus Mode and Focus Task as a stable version
	* Need to automate the workflow such that focusing a task adds it back to a task list
	* Queue in a task from task list after focus task is checked and unfocused
	* Settings input still takes in negative numbers 
* Frontend: 
	* UI is pretty much finalized
	* Necessity remains to focus on responsive design and automated scaling of elements when
	  window resizes
	* Since UI is finalized, need to complete the help popup
* Testing:
	* Unit tests are up to date for the buttons branch
	* Unit tests should be up to date for entire codebase
	* Necessity remains to figure out Cypress coverage
		* this must be completed by tonight
* Went through a demo of our current application
* Stable version should include a finalized help popup and an automated workflow for the focus task
* Integration testing is almost finished -- next step is end-to-end and cross browser testing
* Went over the presentation videos, both private and public versions by each bullet point:
	* Created google doc to keep track of requirements for each member
	* Send the snippet of your part of the video to Jackie so she can tie it together and edit 
   
## Plan
* Yuefeng will work on the button click sound and keyboard shortcut for the focus mode
* Backend will work on finalizing the automated workflow for the focus mode
* Settings popup will need to prevent input of negative and decimal numbers
