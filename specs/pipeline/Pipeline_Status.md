## Linting and code style

We use ESLint to check code style with plugin in VSCode. Each team member is responsible for download and intall the tool. As tested, this local check of styling works.

Husky will runs ESLint on commit, if the style is wrong, the commite will be blocked. As tested, this tool works.

## Code quality

We use Code Climate run through GH Action to check code quality. This works

## Unit test

We use Jest tests run through GH Action for unit testing. This works.
