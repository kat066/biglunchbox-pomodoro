# [Reposition the Reset button]

* Date: [2021-02-18]

## Context and Problem Statement

[The reset button is probably confusing for users when it sits next to the start/stop button, we decide to move it to a new position since it will not be used frequently]

## Considered Options

* [Not moving, stay the same]
* [Move to the top right corner next to the setting/help]
* [Remove it completely]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 2]", because [Although it's not a frequently used button, it's still needed for better flexibility for users. Putting it right next to the stop button might confuse the users and since it's not a frequent used button, it doesn't have to be at the center right next to our timer, which should be less noticable but still there to provide an option. Putting it next to the setting should make more sense. It can also distinguish itself from start/stop by sitting in the corner].
