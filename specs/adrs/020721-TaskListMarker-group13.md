# [Using check marks on tasks list instead of crossline and faded effect]

* Date: [2021-02-07]

## Context and Problem Statement

[We want to give the users a better visual candy on how they are processing with the task list, we decide to let the user put their checker on each task to indicate that specific task is finished and checked off.]

## Considered Options

* [Check Marks]
* [Strikethroughs]
* [Black Out]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [It looks better. It is easy to use for the users and more intuitive than other options].
