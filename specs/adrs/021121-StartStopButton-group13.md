# [Combine Start and Stop button and add a Reset button]

* Date: [2021-02-11]

## Context and Problem Statement

[Having three separated (start, stop and reset) buttons might be confusing and unnecessary, the web page should be easy and intuitive.]

## Considered Options

* [Keep the same, 3 buttons, start, stop, reset]
* [combine start and stop, the text and functionality changes at click, and add a new reset botton below the timer]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[2]", because [It's easier for the users to understand the webpage and the users will have a less chance to get confused. We shouldn't have too many buttons in the page. We will also make the help page clear to inform the user what the Start/Stop button and Reset button do respectively].
