# [The overall webpage design]

* Date: [2021-01-24]

## Context and Problem Statement

[We want to decide how the webpage should be like, the overall design language to use]

## Considered Options

* [minimalist]
* [dark mode]
* [round corner]
* [soft colors]
* [optional features]
* [Big font]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1,3,4]", because [we want our users to feel relaxing while the timer is actually counting down, to reduce the anxiety, we should use soft colors and round corner, less
addtional features and to be as simplier as we can while providing enough features for the users].
