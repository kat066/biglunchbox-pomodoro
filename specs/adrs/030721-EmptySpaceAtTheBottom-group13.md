# [About the empty space at the bottom on our app]

* Date: [2021-03-07]

## Context and Problem Statement

[Users on a larger monitor might experience a large gap at the buttom of the app, we are trying to decide what to do with the space.]

## Considered Options

* [leave it there]
* [Use relative sizing to cover the empty space with the timer/task list]
* [Put a focus task below the timer and extend the task list]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 3]", because [user can focus more on the focus task right below the timer and it can also cover up the empty space at the bottom].

Fall back option : "[option 2]", because [time constraint. We probably won't have enough timer to fully develop this feature and test it throughly so we might just re-sizing the elements to fill up  the empty space.]
